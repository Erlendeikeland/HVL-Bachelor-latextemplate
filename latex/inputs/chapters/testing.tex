\section{Testing}
This chapter is a very important part of design projects. You may drop this chapter if the project is a data collecting and analyzing project.

You must perform a test of the final system. You should plan this test as an element that is just as significant as the other phases of the project. To avoid surprising elements in the final stages of the project, you should carry out various sub-tests during design and implementation. The goal is to identify errors at an early stage in the design process, and thus take actions that do not affect the rest of the selected solutions. It is easier to change parts of a design before fulfilment of the entire design.

Describe your test plan and actual tests and describe how you handled errors, tolerances, accuracy etc.
