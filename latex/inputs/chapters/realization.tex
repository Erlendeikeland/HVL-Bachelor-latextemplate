\section{Realization of the selected solution}
Concrete design of the selected solution with the chosen tools and platforms. Include necessary documentation for the thesis. Some projects require a more thorough and detailed description than other.

Long lists of programming code and other similar documentation should not be included here. Include such lists in an appendix unless the lists are too comprehensive. It is more common to hand in such lists digitally along with the report.

This chapter is normally quite comprehensive.
