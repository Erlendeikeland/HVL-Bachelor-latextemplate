\section{Problem analysis}
The analysis connects the specification of requirements to the design. This section is a more thorough analysis based on the specification of requirements A good idea is to split the system into sub-systems, each having their own specification of requirements. It is usually necessary to consult the contracting entity to specify details regarding requirements and wishes, and to get an overview of possibilities and specifications of existing systems. In other words, the analysis is to split the specified requirements into manageable pieces. The goal of the analysis is to give a detailed and partly general description of the specified requirements (unless the contracting entity have specific requirements for the use of tools and platform). A good analysis is a good basis for the design phase.

\subsection{Description of possible solutions}
This section describes possible designs of solution(s) for the problem. Examples are required purchases, hardware and software installation, coding of custom made, operational organization, user training, documentation of the system, routines etc. This section also specifies specific requirements for the solution from the contracting entity. If possible, it is useful to specify a selection of alternative solutions.

\subsubsection{Solution alternative 1}

\subsubsection{Solution alternative 2}

\subsubsection{Issues regarding tools and HW/SW components}
This section is for a brief description of necessary tools for the project. Specify the selection criteria for each selected tool. Former knowledge, user experience and estimated time used for training are also a parts of the selection criteria.
If the contracting entity has given specific criteria regarding the tools and components, this section should rather discuss benefits and drawbacks with respect to other tools and platforms that could have given a similar or better result.
If there is a selection of available for the tools and components, you should use sub-sections, much like the chapter above.

\subsection{Problem analysis conclusion}
Discuss the best alternatives and justify your choices.
